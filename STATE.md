# STATE — externalized progress (update at end of every session)

Last updated: 2026-09-05 (session 1, Orchestrator: Claude Fable 5.1)

## Done
- Spec + plan grilled and approved 2026-09-05.
- Phase 1 skeleton reviewed and pushed as `build-0001` (public repo github.com/ggjordan/trippy, 27 CPU tests green).
- feat/points merged (build-0004): PointSet, GaussianPlySource (5.74M pts on kk-coherent, median nn 0.080), density CLI; 50 tests green.
- Merged: raster forward (Metal = reference to 2e-6; 41.6 ms @1008x756/200k pts), net port (34/34 tensors match the public horse checkpoint with num_layers=8), scene loader, PLY export/sheets/video. build-0009, 187 tests.
- docs/TRIPS_REFERENCE.md written from source (key finding: TRIPS's shipped default broadcasts every point into all 5 layers; the 2-layer trilinear path exists but is unreachable from configs).
- Jordan set the goal (2026-09-05 ~22:50): finish all stages autonomously; anything needing Jordan goes in the review queue below.

## In flight
- feat/render-kk (mid/high): `trippy render` on kk-coherent from 5.7M Gaussian centres, contact sheets, delivery (EXP-0001).
- feat/adop-parity (large/high): authors' horse checkpoint through our rasteriser+U-Net vs GT, PSNR (EXP-0002, the v0.1.0 gate).
- feat/raster-bwd (large/high): Metal blend_bwd + autograd.Function + gradcheck vs float64 reference.
- feat/train (mid/high): trainer (crops, param groups, schedule, losses, eval, export) built against the CPU-differentiable path.
- feat/monodepth (mid/normal): MonoDepthSource via DepthPro on the GPU queue, scale-aligned to sparse depths.

## Next (in order)
1. Merge scene-io + points; launch feat/raster (large/high: numpy reference + Metal blend_fwd + pyramid forward) and feat/net (mid/high: U-Net + tone mapper ports) once TRIPS_REFERENCE.md lands.
2. v0.1.0: colmap_io, xform_a/b, dataset, GaussianPlySource, ref_numpy, blend_fwd pyramid forward, U-Net tone mapper.
3. v0.2.0: blend_bwd gradcheck, trainer, MonoDepthSource, eval/export/dolly, source experiments.
4. v0.3.0: Hybrid designs C then A1, comparison harness.
5. v0.4.0: Brush fork viewer (Mac), v0.5.0 web viewer, Quest measurement.

## Blocked
- None.

## Open questions for Jordan (review queue; nothing blocks on these)
- None yet.
