# Limitations and constraints

## Hardware and software

- **No 64-bit atomics on Metal via `torch.mps.compile_shader`**: This rules out TRIPS's reference depth/id packing trick. Our design avoids atomics entirely by pre-sorting fragments and using segment offsets instead.

- **No float64 on MPS**: gradient checking (gradcheck) must run on CPU. We validate gradients at float32 precision on GPU and float64 on CPU before any MPS job, but cannot run float64 gradcheck directly on the GPU.

- **int64 argsort at 50M elements unverified**: sorting 7.36M points × up to 8 fragments per point can produce ≤50M fragments. PyTorch's int64 argsort is not guaranteed stable at this scale on MPS. We have a fallback: two stable 32-bit sorts (Brush's pattern, e.g., radix sort by layer first, then by pixel+depth).

- **Perceptual loss differs from TRIPS's caffe VGG**: we use `torchvision.models.vgg16` + `lpips` for perceptual loss. TRIPS's original uses caffe VGG. Results may differ slightly. We do not attempt to port the caffe model; the difference is noted and accepted.

## Data and geometry

- **Distortion refinement out of scope**: COLMAP models include lens distortion parameters, but we apply them once during dataset loading (undistort) and do not refine them during training. If distortion changes during training (e.g., due to pose drift), it will not be corrected.

- **iPhone LiDAR 5 m range, incomplete coverage**: LiDAR on iPhone 13 Pro Max has a ~5 m practical range and often fails on glass/reflective surfaces. Scenes exceeding 5 m or with reflective geometry require depth backfill from monocular depth (DepthPro/MoGe). This is handled via `UnionSource` but cannot be automated.

## Quest rendering

- **~120 GFLOP per eye per frame**: A CNN per eye per frame at mobile headset resolution (≈1024×1024) requires approximately 120 billion floating-point operations. This exceeds the typical throughput budget of a mobile GPU (~30 GFLOP/s for sustained load), meaning interactive rendering on Quest is not expected.

- **Measurement deferred until v0.5.0**: We will measure the web viewer on a Quest browser once the web viewer ships. If fps is unacceptable (<15 fps), we ship a fallback: distilled Gaussians via the existing `~/Splats/tools/publish/publish_splat.sh` path, or fly-through MP4 videos.

## Memory and disk

- **96 GB unified memory on this Mac**: sufficient for training at half-resolution (1024 wide) with crop sizes 384–512 and batch size 1. Full-resolution training would require careful scheduling or gradient checkpointing.

- **Disk was 93% full on 2026-09-05**: scenes and PLYs are read in place from `SPLATS_ROOT` (an environment variable, never a copy); run outputs live under `output/` (gitignored) and `scripts/deliver.sh` symlinks them into the review folder rather than copying.

## Reproduction

- **Public Zenodo scene only**: this repo is public. We use a public TRIPS scene from Zenodo (record 10687419, CC-BY) as the reproducible example for outsiders. Jordan's Karekare and Hunua scenes are private and must never be committed.

- **No checkpoint files committed**: trained models (`.pt`, `.pth`, `.safetensors`) are delivered via `scripts/deliver.sh` to `~/Splats/output/Jordan-Review/`, outside the repo. The repo contains only training code and public data.

## Pyramid rasteriser forward pass (v0.1.0)

- **The MPS forward is not differentiable.** `blend_fwd.metal` is forward-only; `trippy.raster.pyramid.render_pyramid` detaches the fragment alphas and features before handing them to the kernel, so a render on `device="mps"` produces no gradients. Emission, sorting and segmentation are ordinary torch, so gradients will flow the moment `blend_bwd` lands (v0.2.0). Until then, gradcheck and any autograd work must run on CPU, where `render_pyramid` dispatches to `trippy.raster.ref_torch` (which *is* differentiable, in float64).

- **Fragments below `RASTER_ALPHA_MIN` (1e-5) are dropped at emission.** TRIPS keeps every in-bounds bilinear corner. We drop the negligible ones because each costs a slot in the 16-deep per-pixel list; the composite changes by at most 1e-5 × the feature magnitude. All three implementations (numpy, torch, Metal) apply the identical rule, so the references stay comparable, but a bit-exact TRIPS comparison would need it set to 0.

- **The background is always added as `T_final · bg`.** TRIPS only adds it when `alpha_dest >= ALPHA_DEST_CUTOFF` (`RenderForward.cu:3610`), i.e. it hard-zeroes a residual of up to 0.001. Ours is the continuous version — the difference is ≤0.001 × bg and it avoids a discontinuity in the loss.

- **The out-of-bounds test is per fragment, not per point.** TRIPS rejects a point's *whole* 2×2 footprint at a layer if `floor(ip)` is out of range, and then abandons the remaining (coarser) layers entirely: the broadcast kernel `break`s out of the layer loop (`RenderForward.cu:1610-1620`) and the point-size kernel nests the `layer_higher` write inside the `layer_lower` bounds check (`RenderForward.cu:2296-2360`), so a point on the border loses its coarse-layer contribution too. We test each of the four corners independently and each layer independently, so a point straddling the border still contributes its in-bounds corners, and a point off the edge of layer 0 can still draw in a coarse layer. This is strictly more correct at borders; it also means our fragment counts near the frame edge do not match TRIPS's.

- **Pyramid layers use `ceil` halving, TRIPS uses integer division.** See docs/GEOMETRY.md. Odd-sized images differ in the last row/column of every layer.

- **`use_layer_point_size` mode parity is untestable against a TRIPS checkpoint.** `mode="trilinear"` ports a code path that no shipped TRIPS `.ini` can enable (docs/TRIPS_REFERENCE.md §11), so it can never be validated against a released TRIPS checkpoint — only against our own references. `mode="broadcast"` is the mode a TRIPS checkpoint would have been trained in.

- **Fragment memory scales with the mode.** In `broadcast` mode a point emits up to `4 × L = 20` fragments, not 8. At 7.36M points and L=5 that is up to 147M fragments before the bounds cull, well past the 50M figure assumed above for int64 argsort; large scenes will need tiling or crop-based rendering (the trainer already renders 384–512 px crops).

- **Composite sort key caps the pyramid at 2^31 layer-pixels.** The key packs `layer_pixel << 32 | float32_bits(depth)` into an int64. Beyond ~2.1 G layer-pixels (far above any realistic frame) `sort_fragments` raises and the `two_pass` fallback must be used; it has no such limit.

- **Depth is compared at float32 resolution in both sort paths**, because the composite key has only 32 bits for it. Two fragments whose depths differ only below float32 resolution are ordered by point index, not by true depth.
